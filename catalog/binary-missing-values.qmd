Presence of high quantities of missing data primarily within a column—as
opposed to being distributed across rows and columns—can be a smell that the
data is not truly missing. The missing values in such cases may carry an
implicit meaning of a negative binary response. This can be validated further
by observing the column header along with the non-missing values of the
feature(s) in question. If the non-missing data is indicative of a positive
response such as ‘{t,T}rue’ or ‘{y,Y}es’ then the missing data may indicate
a negative response.

# Data Smells Catalog

This repository contains the source code for the website
<https://arumoy.me/data-smells>.

This project originated from a research project where I analyzed 25 popular ML
datasets from Kaggle and identified 14 data antipatterns (or "smells" in Software
Engineering lingo).

You can find an overview of the research project and results [in this
blogpost](https://arumoy.me/blogs/data-smells-public-datasets/) I wrote. You can
also read the full research paper on [ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.08007).
